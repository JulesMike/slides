* Software engineering v/s Programming

    Software engineering is what happens to programming when you add time and other programmers.
    
    –Russ Cox, GopherCon Singapore 2018

What is Programming?

    Programming is the process of taking an algorithm and encoding it into a notation, 
    a programming language, so that it can be executed by a computer.

    -https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/Introduction/WhatIsProgramming.html

Software engineering = `Programming`  *x*  `programmers`  *x*  `time`

However, the more programmers added does not mean the better...

* Contention

Programmers come from various programming backgrounds and often, when teamed up on a similiar project using a specific programming language, contentions arise.

- Aiming at those sweet style points (e.g semicolon/curly brace/oneliner wars)
- How do I name thee? (e.g variable/function/method/type/package/file/test naming)
- We need to go deeper! (e.g nesting, recursion)
- Now you see me, now you don't! (e.g public vs private) 
- Pirate everything! (e.g licensing)

* Code structure
How do we structure this whole mess?
Abstract Factory? Builder? Factory Method? Object Pool? Prototype? Singleton? Adapter? Composite? Decorator? Hexagonal?

* Code Quality

    Complexity is anything that makes software hard to understand or to modify.

    –John Ousterhout, A Philosophy of Software Design

* Disclaimers:

- No specific order (even this list)
- Not final (very much a WIP)
- "Toute catégorie confondue"
- Some guidelines are taken care of at language-design level
- Mere presentation: a proper compilation incoming (not everything fits in slides)

* Clarity ≠ Readability

Readability:

- nit picking about line length and variable names. 
- holy wars about brace position. 
- the hand to hand combat of style guides and code review guidelines that regulate the use of whitespace.

Clarity:

- the property of the code on the page. 
- concerned with what the code is doing, not just how it is written down.

    The most important skill for a programmer is the ability to effectively communicate ideas.

    –Gastón Jorquera

* Simplicity

“I can’t understand this code”

    The ability to simplify means to eliminate the unnecessary so that the necessary may speak

    –Hans Hofmann

Too often, we add noise to our codebase.

Complexity:

- Unreliable software. 
- Unmaintainable software.
- Kills software projects. 

Clarity and simplicity are interlocking forces that lead to maintainable software.

* Productivity

Go programmers realise that code is written to be read and so place the act of reading code above the act of writing it.

    Design is the art of arranging code to work today, and be changeable forever.

    –Sandi Metz

- Go programmers don’t spend days debugging inscrutable compile errors. 
- They don’t waste days with complicated build scripts or deploying code to production. 
- And most importantly they don’t spend their time trying to understand what their coworker wrote.

Go was designed so programmers feel as *productive* as their counterparts working in dynamic languages without the maintenance issues inherent in those languages.

* Go fmt yourself!

Every single Go source file must be formatted with `Gofmt`.

    Gofmt's style is no one's favorite, yet gofmt is everyone's favorite.

    -Rob Pike, Gopherfest, November 2015

Moreover, code should be visually inspected.

- Go goes so far as to enforce, via tooling and custom, that all code be formatted in a specific style. This removes the friction of learning a project specific dialect and helps spot mistakes because they *just* *look* *incorrect*.

* Go vet

A happy `go vet` is a happy developer!

    asmdecl      report mismatches between assembly files and Go declarations
    assign       check for useless assignments
    atomic       check for common mistakes using the sync/atomic package
    bools        check for common mistakes involving boolean operators
    buildtag     check that +build tags are well-formed and correctly located
    cgocall      detect some violations of the cgo pointer passing rules
    composites   check for unkeyed composite literals
    copylocks    check for locks erroneously passed by value
    httpresponse check for mistakes using HTTP responses
    loopclosure  check references to loop variables from within nested functions
    lostcancel   check cancel func returned by context.WithCancel is called
    nilfunc      check for useless comparisons between functions and nil
    printf       check consistency of Printf format strings and arguments
    shift        check for shifts that equal or exceed the width of the integer
    stdmethods   check signature of methods of well-known interfaces
    structtag    check that struct field tags conform to reflect.StructTag.Get
    tests        check for common mistaken usages of tests and examples
    unmarshal    report passing non-pointer or non-interface values to unmarshal
    unreachable  check for unreachable code
    unsafeptr    check for invalid conversions of uintptr to unsafe.Pointer
    unusedresult check for unused results of calls to some functions

* Comment

- Comment should be written in full sentences even if it feels redundant. 
    // Request represents a request to run a command.
    type Request struct { ...

- Space should be inserted after `//`
    // BAD
    //Request ...
 
    // GOOD
    // Request ...

- Comment tags
    // List of comment tags
    // TODO, FIXME, BUG, HACK, INFO, DONE

    // Comment tags should be authored properly
    // HACK(mike): This is fugly and had to be done in a rush


At the end of the day, source code comments serves as documentation on `godoc`.

* Package names

- Short, concise & evocative
    package bytes // import "bytes"

    package base64 // import "encoding/base64" NOT "encoding_base64 or "encodingBase64"

    package http // import "net/http"

- Do not stutter
    package xyz

    // Bad
    func NewXYZ(){ ... }
 
    // Good
    func New(){ ... }

- If name collision on `import`, prefer to rename the most local or project-specific import. 

* Errors

- No In-Band Errors
    // Lookup returns the value for key or "" if there is no mapping for key.
    // BAD
    func Lookup(key string) string
 
    // Lookup returns the value for key or ok=false if there is no mapping for key.
    // GOOD
    func Lookup(key string) (value string, ok bool)

- *Handle* every Error
    // BAD
    c, _ := new Client()
 
    // GOOD
    c, err := new Client()
    if err != nil { ... }

* Errors (continued)

- Keep indentation to a minimal
    // BAD
    if err != nil {
        // error handling
    } else {
        // normal code
    }
 
    // GOOD
    if err != nil {
        // error handling
        return // or continue, etc.
    }
    // normal code

* Initialisms

Words in names that are initialisms or acronyms (e.g. "URL" or "NATO") have a consistent case

    // BAD
    var isurl bool
    clientId := client.ID()
    func servehttp() { ... }
 
    // GOOD
    var isURL bool
    clientID := client.ID()
    func serveHTTP() { ... }

* Globals

Generally, global states are bad.
They limit testability of packages.

    // BAD
    const baseURL = "https://myapp.prod.mu"
    type Fetcher struct { ... }
    func(f Fetcher) Resource(url string) (*Resource, err) {
        // use `baseURL` to fetch resource at `url`
    }
 
    // GOOD
    type Fetcher struct { 
        baseURL string 
    }
    func(f Fetcher) Resource(url string) (*Resource, err) {
        // use `f.baseURL` to fetch resource at `url`
    }

* Line Length

There's no hard-limit but there's a thing as uncomfortably long.

- Do not add line breaks just to shorten a line. Be wise!

    // BAD
    // This is a very long commment and it makes sense to shorten it at some 
    // point but when do we shorten it?
 
    // BETTER
    // This is a very long commment and it makes sense to shorten it at some point 
    // but when do we shorten it?

- Sometimes it is wiser to be concise,

    // GOOD
    // This is comment is very long and should be shortened

- Or simply change the names or the semantics for better results.

* Mixed Caps

Either you PascalCase (exported) or you camelCase (unexported).

    // BAD
    var is_url bool
    const (
        max_url_len = 32
        MIN_URL_LEN = 5
    )
    func Fetch_Resource() { ... }
 
    // GOOD
    var isURL bool
    const (
        MinURLLen = 5       // exported
        maxURLLen = 32      // unexported
    )
    func FetchResource() { ... }

Even if it breaks conventions in other languages.

* Named Result Parameters

Useful for documentation purposes when two or more parameters of the same type is returned

    // BAD
    func (f *Foo) Location() (float64, float64, error)

    // GOOD
    // Location returns f's latitude and longitude.
    // Negative values mean south and west, respectively.
    func (f *Foo) Location() (lat, long float64, err error)

Should not be used just to save lines of code in the function's body.

* Identifier names

Basic rules: 

- Keep the name *short* and *simple*.
- The *further* from its declaration that a name is used, the more *descriptive* the name must be. 
- For a method receiver, one or two letters is sufficient. 
- Common variables such as loop indices and readers can be a single letter (i, r). 
- More unusual things and global variables need more descriptive names.
- Do not prefix *Get* for getters; only prefix *Set* for setters.
- Error values should be prefixed with *Err*.

* Receiver type

- If the receiver is a map, func or chan, don't use a pointer to them
- If the method needs to *mutate* the receiver, the receiver must be a pointer.
- If the receiver is a struct that contains a sync.Mutex or similar *synchronizing* *field*, the receiver must be a pointer to avoid copying.
- If the receiver is a large struct or array, a pointer receiver is more *efficient*.
- If the receiver is a struct, array or slice and any of its elements is a pointer to something that might be mutating, prefer a pointer receiver; *intention* more clear to the reader.
- If the receiver is a small array or struct that is naturally a value type (for instance, something like the time.Time type), with no mutable fields and no pointers, or is just a simple basic type such as int or string, a value receiver makes sense.
- If for performance reason only, *profile* first!
- Finally, when in *doubt*, use a pointer receiver.

* Switch

Idiomatic to re-write a long *if-elseif-else* chain as a *switch*.

    switch {
    case '0' <= c && c <= '9':
        return c - '0'
    case 'a' <= c && c <= 'f':
        return c - 'a' + 10
    case 'A' <= c && c <= 'F':
        return c - 'A' + 10
    }
 
    switch c {
    case ' ', '?', '&', '=', '#', '+', '%':
        return true
    }
 
    switch {
    case p.Code == "":
        return errors.New("code can't be empty")
    case p.Name == "":
        return errors.New("name can't be empty")
    }

* External Packages

- New packages should be vet'd properly before adding to a project. (i.e proper license, maintained, popular, tested, code quality)
- Packages which need to be updated needs to be tested for breaking changes in API.
- Packages should be hosted on proper source version platform. (e.g Github, Gitlab)
- Tools like *golicense* should be used to regularly scan dependencies' license.

* Testing

Packages should be tested with proper coverage (70+%).
However, test coverage does not guarantee good testing practices.
 
- Tests should use *testify* package.
- Tests' package name should be suffixed with "_test".
- Tests should be properly *documented*.
- Where setup is needed, test *suites* should be used. 
- For complex input and/or output, test *fixtures* should be used.
- Tests should use *table-driven* testing where necessary.
- Tests should fail with proper messages about what case failed and what was *got* compared to what was *expected*.
- Build tools should run the tests and stop when the tests fail.

* Benchmarking

For I/O intensive or performance critical tasks, benchmarking should be done. 

- Benchmarking is pointless unless the results are properly analysed and compared. *Benchcmp* should be used to compare benchmark results.
- In some cases, the benchmark *timer* must be controlled manually for accurate results. (e.g *b.StartTimer()*, *b.StopTimer()* and *b.ResetTimer()*)

* Profiling

One way of correct bottlenecks found using benchmarking is profiling.

Three popular types of profiling: Memory, CPU and Goroutine.

- CPU profile determines where a program spends its time while actively consuming CPU cycles (as opposed to while sleeping or waiting for I/O).
- Memory (Heap) profile reports memory allocation samples; used to monitor current and historical memory usage, and to check for memory leaks.
- Goroutine profile reports the stack traces of all current goroutines.
